# EmbeddedC-Neural-Network-Model
A model to run a neural network in C (to be ported to STM32 or any other C-based microcontroller). Given the inputs and weights, it will predict an output.

Created as an Xcode project.

All you need to do is create nodes and add them to a layer. Can be extended to any number of nodes and layers. Nodes can either be sigmoid or linear.
